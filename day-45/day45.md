# 🚀 #Day45 of the #50DaysofCodeChallenge: Mastering NeoGcamp Assignments with Two API Servers and Comprehensive Documentations! 🚀

## Hello #LinkedInConnections! 👋

### Day 45 has been a day of coding achievements and project completions. Here's a glimpse into my coding journey today:

🌐 NeoGcamp Assignments: I'm thrilled to share that I completed not one, but four assignments at NeoGcamp! These projects included the creation of two API servers and the meticulous documentation of these APIs. Crafting APIs is a crucial skill in modern web development, and documenting them ensures seamless integration for users.

Tripy Destination API Documentation:- (https://lnkd.in/dP2r4Ysq)

NeoG User API Documentation:- (https://lnkd.in/du89pEFx)

Completing these assignments is a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and practical application.

As I continue this coding challenge, I'm excited about the endless possibilities and the impact my coding skills can make in the tech world.

Onwards to Day 46, where fresh coding horizons await with enthusiasm! 🌟
With Prakhar Pandey & Mohammad Khan
