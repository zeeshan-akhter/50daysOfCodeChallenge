# 🚀 #Day22 of the #50DaysofCodeChallenge: Documenting APIs, Express.js Insights, and Functional Programming Prowess! 🚀

## Hello #LinkedInConnections! 👋

### Day 22 of the 50 Days of Code Challenge has been a whirlwind of productivity and learning. Here's a glimpse into my coding journey today:

📖 API Documentation: Today, I embarked on the important task of documenting APIs using Postman. Effective documentation is the cornerstone of seamless communication in the world of software development, and I'm committed to crafting clear and comprehensive guides for my APIs.

🎓 Express.js Wisdom: I attended an enlightening Express.js class at neoG Camp. Topics like CORS, Helmet, API versioning, and global 404 middleware were explored, enhancing my understanding of creating secure and efficient web applications.

🧩 Functional Programming Triumphs: I continued my journey through the world of functional programming, solving complex problems and sharpening my problem-solving skills.

As I embrace these diverse challenges, I'm reminded of the multifaceted nature of coding and the need for constant adaptation and growth.

Onwards to Day 23, where new coding adventures await with enthusiasm! With Prakhar Pandey & Mohammad Khan
