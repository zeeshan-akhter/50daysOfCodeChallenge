# 🚀 #Day26 of the #50DaysofCodeChallenge: Express.js Mastery and the Art of Problem-Solving! 🚀

## Hello #LinkedInConnections! 👋

### Day 26 has been a day of deepening my coding knowledge and problem-solving finesse. Here's a glimpse into my coding journey today:

📚 Express.js Insights: I attended an enlightening class on Express.js at neoGcamp. Topics like bcrypt, hashing, and authentication were demystified, and I gained hands-on experience in implementing these essential concepts. Strengthening my grasp on these security measures is vital for building robust web applications.

🧩 Functional Programming Continues: My exploration of functional programming persisted as I tackled more questions. Each solution is a reminder of the elegance and efficiency this paradigm brings to code.

As I continue on this coding challenge, I'm reminded of the importance of both security and efficiency in crafting quality software.

Onwards to Day 27, where fresh coding adventures await with enthusiasm!
With Prakhar Pandey & Mohammad Khan

Stay curious, stay coding! 💻🔐
