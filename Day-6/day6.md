# 🚀 #Day6 of the #50DaysofCodeChallenge: TypeScript Deep Dive and Crafting a React Quiz App! 🚀

## Hello #LinkedInConnections! 👋

### What a fulfilling day it has been on this remarkable coding journey! Day 6 of the 50 Days of Code Challenge has been a fusion of learning and hands-on application that's left me invigorated and excited to share my progress:

🔷 Exploring TypeScript: My exploration of TypeScript continues to deepen, and today's live lecture was a treasure trove of insights. I delved into the syntax of types and interfaces, gained proficiency in utilizing map, filter, reduce, and predicate functions, and absorbed valuable insights that will undoubtedly elevate my coding endeavors.

🖥️ React TypeScript Triumph: I took on the exciting task of crafting a React quiz app using TypeScript. Leveraging the power of useState(), useReducer(), and useContext(), along with custom React hooks, I built an interactive and dynamic quiz experience that showcases the synergy between React and TypeScript.
