# 🚀 #Day33 of the #50DaysofCodeChallenge: Sketching React Internals and Code Wars Conquests! 🚀

## Hello #LinkedInConnections! 👋

### Day 33 has been a day of in-depth exploration and problem-solving prowess. Here's a glimpse into my coding journey today:

🖌️ Sketching React Internals: I attended an enlightening session at neoGcamp where I delved into the inner workings of React. Understanding the core of this powerful library is crucial for crafting efficient and dynamic web applications.

🧩 Code Wars Triumphs: I embraced the challenge of solving three Code Wars problems today. These coding puzzles are a fantastic way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and discover new coding techniques.

As I progress through this coding challenge, I'm reminded of the importance of both theory and practice in becoming a well-rounded developer.

Onwards to Day 34, where new coding horizons await with enthusiasm! 🌟
With Prakhar Pandey & Mohammad Khan
